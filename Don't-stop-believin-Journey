Don’t Stop Believin’  by Journey

[Intro]
PIANO/BASS

[Verse 1]
E         B               C#m             A
   Just a small town girl,    living in a lonely world
E               B                    G#m   A
   She took the midnight train going anywhere

[Verse 2]
E         B        C#m                    A
   Just a city boy,    born and raised in south Detroit
E              B                    G#m   A
   He took the midnight train going anywhere

[V.3 INSTRUMENTAL](guitar entrance 4 bars in)

[Verse 4]
E                 B        C#m
  A singer in a smoky room,
                        A
  the smell of wine and cheap perfume
E                       B                        G#m
   For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on
     A
 and on and on

[Chorus]
A                 E
Strangers waiting    up and down the boulevard
      A                             E
Their shadows     searching in the night
A                    E
Streetlight, people,   living just to find emotion
A                        B    E    B  E  A
Hiding, somewhere in the night

[Instrumental]
E B C#m A

[Verse 5]
E                  B         C#m             A
   Working hard to get my fill,    everybody wants a thrill
 E                     B                  G#m       A
   Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time

[Verse 6]
E                 B               C#m                  A
   Some will win, some will lose,    some were born to sing the blues
 E               B                   G#m           A
   Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
A                 E
Strangers waiting    up and down the boulevard
      A                           E
Their shadows searching    in the night
A                     E
Streetlights, people,   living just to find emotion
A                        B   E    B  E  A
Hiding, somewhere in the night

[GUITAR SOLO OVER VERSE CHORDS]
E         B               C#m         A
E         B               G#m         A

E          B          C#m              A
Don't stop believing    hold on to the feeling
E           B           G#m           A
Streetlight people  oo-oh
E          B          C#m              A
Don't stop believing    hold on to the feeling
E           B           G#m           A
Streetlight people   oo-oh

E          B          C#m              A
Don't stop believing    hold on to the feeling

Streetlight people   oo-oh
