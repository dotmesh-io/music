[Intro]

Em  
(with blues fills)
Mmmmm     mmmm    oooooo  (ad lib)


[Verse]

Em
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Em
Jamie Rogers on electro up high
Em
Mamas dancing - baby on her shoulder
Em
The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
    B                               A
The boy could sing and knew how to move  -  everything
G                      D
Always wanting more    -   it leaves you longing for


[Chorus]

A                     D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
A                       F            C        
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A                      D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 C       B                    Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please


[Verse]

Em 
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
Em 
White lightening, bound to drive you wild
Em 
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
Em 
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
B                               A
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
G                    D
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for


[Chorus]

A                     D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
A                       F            C        
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A                      D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 C       B                   Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please


[Bridge]

A                   B                         Em
Every word of every song that he sang is for you
A                  F                   C7      N.C.      B7          Em
In a flash he was gone  -  it happened so soon    -    what could you do?


[Chorus]

A                     D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
A                       F            C        
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A                      D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 C       B                    Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please




A                     D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
A                       F            C        
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A                      D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 C       B                    Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please
