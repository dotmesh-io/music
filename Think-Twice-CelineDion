[Verse 1]
Dm                                   Gm
    Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
C                                       Am      Bb
    You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
Dm                                 Gm   
    I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
C                                    Am      Bb
    And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
Gm                  C
    This is getting serious
Gm                         C      Bb
    Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
          F               Bb       C
    Don't say what you're 'bout to say
         F               Am       Bb   C
    Look back before you leave my life
       F               Bb         C
    Be sure before you close that door
               Gm         Bb
    Before you roll those dice
               F      Gm
    Baby think twice

[Verse 2]
              Dm                                      Gm
   Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
C                                      Am      Bb
   For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Dm                                                    Gm
   Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
C                                             Am      Bb
   'Coz when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
Gm                  C
   But baby this is serious
Gm                        C
   Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
          F               Bb       C
    Don't say what you're 'bout to say
         F               Am       Bb   C
    Look back before you leave my life
       F               Bb         C
    Be sure before you close that door
               Gm         Bb
    Before you roll those dice
               Dm
    Baby think twice

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Gm  Bb             C
    Baby this is serious
Gm  Bb                      C  
    Are you thinking 'bout you or us
N.C.
    Baby

[Chorus]
          F               Bb       C
    Don't say what you're 'bout to say
         F               Am       Bb   C
    Look back before you leave my life
       F               Bb         C
    Be sure before you close that door
               Gm         Bb
    Before you roll those dice
             F            Bb      C
    Don't do what you're about to do
       F          Am         Bb  C
    My everything depends on you
            F                   Bb    C
    And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
               Gm         Bb
    Before you roll those dice
          F               Bb       C
    Don't say what you're 'bout to say
         F               Am       Bb   C
    Look back before you leave my life
       F               Bb         C
    Be sure before you close that door
               Gm         Bb
    Before you roll those dice
               F
    Baby think twice
